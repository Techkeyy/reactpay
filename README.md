# ⚡ ReactPay

> Trustless freelance escrow powered by Somnia Reactivity — payments that execute themselves.

## What is ReactPay?

ReactPay is a decentralized escrow protocol for freelance payments built on Somnia. A client locks funds on-chain, a freelancer delivers work, and payment releases **automatically** — no middlemen, no fees, no delays.

This is powered by **Somnia Reactivity**. The contract inherits `SomniaEventHandler` and uses `_onEvent` to react to on-chain events in real time:

- Transfer detected → escrow auto-funded ⚡
- Work delivered → payment auto-released ⚡
